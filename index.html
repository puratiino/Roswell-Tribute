        <h2>Roswell is an American science fiction television series</h2>
        <p><strong><< Season one >></strong></p>
        <div id="tribute-info">
        <p>The Pilot is set in 1999. We are introduced to Liz Parker, Maria DeLuca, and Alex Whitman, high school students and best friends residing in the small town of Roswell, New Mexico, site of the famed Roswell UFO incident. Liz Parker's parents own the Crashdown Caf√©, which serves alien-themed dishes.<br> At the beginning of The Pilot, Liz is waitressing in her parents' restaurant when a disagreement between two customers breaks out. A gun goes off, and Liz is accidentally shot. We are now introduced to a character named Max Evans, a seemingly normal high school student, who rushes to Liz's aid and saves her life by healing the gunshot wound with his alien abilities.<br> The healing leaves a silver hand print on her stomach. In order to hide what he has done, Max pours ketchup on Liz before fleeing the scene with his friend Michael Guerin. The shooting acts as a catalyst for the rest of the series' action.</p>

        <p>Liz is presented as an insatiably curious character, obtaining a sample of Max's saliva, analyzes it, and finds that his cells do not look like normal human cells. When she confronts him, Max admits that he, his sister Isabel and their friend Michael, are aliens whose spaceship crashed at Roswell in 1947.<br> In dialogue between other characters we learn that Max, Isabel, and Michael had a pattern of isolating themselves from other students. A love triangle begins between Max, Liz, and Kyle Valenti (the sheriff's son who Liz is dating). </p>

        <p>Though sworn to tell no one, Liz does divulge Max's secret to Maria in the pilot. Eventually Alex also learns about the alien. Secrecy and the tension that surrounds secrets become major themes of the series, important to character development, relationships, and plot. Fear of authority is another theme of the series, and the teenagers must protect the secret from antagonists who are in positions of authority: Roswell's sheriff, Jim Valenti, and a series of FBI agents. </p>
